We designed the plugin with you in mind:

* Gain a greater audience - All translated content creates unique pages with an optimized URL structure that is stored on your servers and sitemaps, ready for indexing from all search engines.
* Built for SEO - The plugin was integrated with leading SEO plugins such as Wordpress SEO and Google XML sitemaps.
* Installation is a breeze - Simple point-and-click installation (no code to install!).  The plugin does require a Bing App ID, but it's free and takes less than two minutes.  We tested this on amateurs and professionals with resounding success.  Anyone looking to translate their site into multiple languages will be done in minutes.
